<div class="first">
<p>These berries come from the Acai palm. Global demand for the fruit expanded rapidly in the 21st century and so the tree is cultivated for that purpose primarily. The acai berry (Euterpe oleraceae) is one of the most nutritious berries on the planet. Also called the Amazonian palm berry, acai is native to the Amazon rainforest. This fruit has been heralded for centuries for its healing, immune-stimulating, energy-boosting properties.

<h3 class="header3">Benefits?</h3>

<div class="second">
<p>Main health benefits of this super food are:</p>
<p><span class="number">1)</span> It promotes heart health. It's full of anthocyanins, a type of antioxidant that supports balanced cholesterol levels. They are also rich in plant sterols that provide cardioprotective benefits, including supporting circulation, improving overall blood composition, and relaxing the blood vessels.</p>
<p><span class="number">2)</span> Acai may help you lose weight and maintain a healthy weight. One interesting study found that eating 200 grams of acai pulp reduced total body fat, reduced skinfolds, and increased insulin sensitivity in overweight women.</p>
<p><span class="number">3)</span> Natural skin care products made with acai oil are a great natural alternative to chemical-based skin care products. Currently, many beauty products contain acai oil because of the oil's high antioxidant content. Its skin care benefits arenâ€™t limited to an external application. When eaten, the berries provide nutrition that can give your skin a healthy glow.</p>
<p><span class="number">4)</span> Acai aids in keeping the digestive system clean and functioning normally. These berries have powerful detoxification capacities, and flour made from the seeds is a good source of dietary fiber.</p>
<p><span class="number">5)</span> Acai berries also contain some other trace minerals, including chromium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, magnesium, potassium and phosphorus. Antioxidants are important because they neutralize the damaging effects of free radicals throughout the body.
Acai berries have an incredibly high amount of antioxidants, edging out other antioxidant-rich fruits like blueberries and cranberries.</p>
<p><span class="number">6)</span> The many plant compounds in acai could also protect your brain from damage as you age.
The antioxidants in acai counteract the damaging effects of inflammation and oxidation in brain cells, which can negatively affect memory and learning.
One of the ways in which the brain stays healthy is by cleaning up cells that are toxic or no longer working, a process known as autophagy. It makes way for new nerves to form, enhancing communication between brain cells.

<p>To make an acai bowl, blend unsweetened frozen puree with water or milk to turn it into a smoothie-like base for toppings. Toppings may include sliced fruit or berries, toasted coconut flakes, nut butters, cocoa nibs or chia seeds. You can also make a bowl using acai powder.</div></p>
