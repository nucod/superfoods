        <p>Chia seeds are tiny dark, oval seeds from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvia_hispanica#/media/File:Salvia_hispanica_(10461546364).jpg">Salvia hispanica</a> plant which comes from in Central and South America.</p>

        <h2>What are the benefits?</h2>
        <p>Chia seeds are rich in <span class='important'>fibre, omega-3 fatty acids, and protein</span>. The combination of fat, protein and fibre means the seeds are digested relatively slowly, providing long, slow release of energy to keep blood-sugar levels stable. They are also rich in minerals such as <span class='important'>calcium and magnesium</span> and trace elements such as manganese.</p>

          <h2>How do you eat them?</h2>
          <p>Chia seeds have a neutral taste compared to other seeds. They can be eaten raw or toasted to add a crunch to salads or breakfast bowls. Also, grounded chia seeds can substitute ingredients in baking.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6", id="what-with-2">
          <p>A popular way of eating chia seeds is to soak them in water or milk and put them in the fridge for at least 2 hours (or overnight). The seeds absorb the liquid to form a gel, which is commonly known as a ‘chia pudding’. Flavour can be added by soaking the chia seeds in flavoured milk or fruit juice, or by adding cinammon, ginger or honey.</p>
