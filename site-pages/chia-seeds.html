    <h2>What are the benefits?</h2>
    <p>Chia seeds are rich in <span class='important'>fibre, omega-3 fatty acids, and protein</span>. The combination of fat, protein and fibre means the seeds are digested relatively slowly, providing long, slow release of energy to keep blood-sugar levels stable. They are also rich in minerals such as <span class='important'>calcium and magnesium</span> and trace elements such as manganese.</p>

    <h2>How do you eat them?</h2>
    <p>Chia seeds have a neutral taste compared to other seeds. They can be eaten raw or toasted to add a crunch to salads or breakfast bowls. Also, grounded chia seeds can substitute ingredients in baking.</p>
    <p>A popular way of eating chia seeds is to soak them in water or milk and put them in the fridge for at least 2 hours (or overnight). The seeds absorb the liquid to form a gel, which is commonly known as a ‘chia pudding’. Flavour can be added by soaking the chia seeds in flavoured milk or fruit juice, or by adding cinammon, ginger or honey.</p>
