  <p>Superfoods are <span class='important'>nutrient-rich natural foods</span> which can have a positive effect on your body. They are mostly plant-based but some fish and dairy are also considered superfood. There is not a set criteria for determining what is and what is not a superfood. The term is largely a marketing tool to influence food trends and sell products, it is not scientific.</p>

  <p>In this website you will find a few examples of foods commonly labelled as superfoods and their typical health benefits.</p>

  <p>Remember that there is no single food that holds the key to good health or disease prevention. A healthy, balanced diet, rich in fruit and vegetables and wholegrain foods paired with regular physical activity is still the key to reduce the risk of some chronic diseases and increase life expectancy.</p>
