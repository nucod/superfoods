<h2 class="header2"> What are they? </h2>

<div class="first">
<p>Baobab is the fruit of Africa's 'Tree of Life'. It is the only fruit in the world that dries naturally on the branch. Baking in the sun for 6 months, baobab's green, prickly, velvet-like coating transforms into a smooth, brown, coconut-like shell. Inside it's hard casing (we use a hammer to crack it open) is the dry white-ish pulp of the fruit which contains no moisture whatsoever.  Its powder is exceptionally nutrient-rich, with an equally impressive range of benefits.

<h3 class="header3"> Benefits? </h3>

<div class="second">
<p><span class="number">1)</span> A single serving of Baobab Powder (2-3 teaspoons) provides 33% of the daily vitamin C requirement. One of the key benefits of vitamin C is that it helps to keep our immune system strong.</p>
  <p><span class="number">2)</span> Baobab Powder contains 34% soluble fibre, this helps to slow down the release of sugars into the blood stream, reducing energy spikes. Soluble fibre can also help to control blood glucose levels, improve blood cholesterol and reduce visceral fat (body fat that is stored around the organs in your abdominal).</p>
  <p><span class="number">3)</span> Approximately 40% of people have at least one digestive symptom at any one time. Insoluble fibre passes through your gut and enables other foods to move through your digestive system easily. It also helps to keep your bowels healthy and prevents digestive problems. The soluble fibers of baobab fruit pulp are prebiotics: non-digestible food components that beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth and activity of beneficial microflora. It's these prebiotic qualities that could explain how baobab might just be the secret to having the world's healthiest gut.</p>
  <p><span class="number">4)</span> Baobab has the highest antioxidant content of any fruit. Baobab powder has twice the antioxidants gram per gram of goji berries and more than blueberries and pomegranates combined. Baobab is packed with antioxidants and vitamin C which supports collagen formation - helping to give you radiant, glowing skin as well as preventing wrinkles. In fact, baobab's skin benefits are so impressive that Aduna Baobab was the first ever food item to be sold in the beauty halls of London department store Liberty.</p>
